## Introduction

In modern backend development, efficient storage management is crucial. This repository covers a range of topics including relational databases, NoSQL databases, caching mechanisms, and file storage. By the end of this project, you will have hands-on experience with various storage solutions and understand their use cases, advantages, and limitations.

## Technologies

This project utilizes the following technologies:

- **Python**: The primary programming language used.
- **SQL**: For relational database management.
- **NoSQL**: For non-relational database management.
- **Redis**: For caching.
- **AWS S3**: For file storage.
- **Docker**: For containerization.
- **Flask**: For creating a simple web application to interact with the storage systems.

## Setup

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
